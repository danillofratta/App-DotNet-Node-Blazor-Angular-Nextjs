# Descrição

This is a simple project to demonstrate some of my knowledge applied to different technologies.
It is a prototype application for scheduling services. Current steps for scheduling:
1. Create a professional
2. Create a service
3. Create a professional and service schedule
4. Schedule the service for the customer
5. Confirm or cancel the service if it was provided or not

Next steps to be implemented:
1. Generate billing and service cost
2. Function to create a service without scheduling
3. Create a separate schedule unlinked to the professional's schedule
